# turntable-player.js

## Spotify app
Enter spotify:app:turntable in the Spotify search bar

## Installation

To use the player, it's really simple : download it and run the index.html page.

The better way to test it is doing it through a web server since we use XmlHttpRequest to retrieve the playlist file. Otherwise, if you directly open the index.html, you must use Firefox (or Safari) since they allow XmlHttpRequest with the "file://" protocol.
